# Dev Agent Personas

Specialist personas provide one role, one perspective, and one report shape.
They can be invoked directly by a user, routed by a Dev Agent command, or used by
a host that supports native subagents.

| Persona | Role | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| [code-reviewer](code-reviewer.md) | Senior Staff Engineer | Five-axis review before merge |
| [product-designer](product-designer.md) | Product Designer | Customer-facing UX, visual systems, references, and screen acceptance |
| [security-auditor](security-auditor.md) | Security Engineer | Vulnerability detection and risk review |
| [test-engineer](test-engineer.md) | QA Engineer | Test strategy, coverage analysis, and proof-oriented verification |
| [ui-quality-reviewer](ui-quality-reviewer.md) | UI Quality Reviewer | Visual comparison scoring, functional QA evidence, and exception screenshot review |

## Composition Rules

- Skills are the process: the how.
- Personas are the perspective: the who.
- Commands are the entrypoint: the when.

Personas do not invoke other personas. If multiple reviews are needed, the main
agent or command should fan out to independent personas, collect reports, and
merge the go/no-go decision.

## Use Cases

- Use `product-designer` before customer-facing UI implementation when visual direction, reference intake, or screen acceptance is needed.
- Use `ui-quality-reviewer` before delivery for visual comparison, functional QA evidence, and exception-only screenshot review.
- Use `code-reviewer` for implementation risk, maintainability, correctness, and regression review.
- Use `security-auditor` for auth, permissions, secrets, payments, data deletion, and other high-risk surfaces.
- Use `test-engineer` for missing coverage, test design, and verification strategy.

## Adding A Persona

1. Create `agents/<role>.md` with the same frontmatter style used by existing personas.
2. Define scope, responsibilities, output format, and hard boundaries.
3. End with a composition block that states when to invoke it directly and when not to.
4. Add the persona to the table above.
5. Document any new orchestration pattern in `references/orchestration-patterns.md`.
