# Quality Gates: {{PROJECT}}

Project-specific verification belongs here. Keep commands runnable from this project folder and mirror them in `bin/check` when they become stable.

## Default Gate
- [ ] Required workflow folders exist
- [ ] Schema and status ledgers exist
- [ ] Context loading guidance exists
- [ ] Host SDKs, CLIs, services, credentials, and permissions are recorded in `.dev-flow/HOST_REQUIREMENTS.md` when known
- [ ] Shared host SDKs are not downloaded into `work/{{PROJECT}}/`
- [ ] `bin/dev-flow env-check {{PROJECT}}` passes before the current build slice or ship scope uses host capabilities
- [ ] Reference intake exists for customer-facing UI work
- [ ] `dev-agent/references/design-artifacts.md` is satisfied when formal visual assets are required
- [ ] `dev-agent/references/figma-handoff.md` is satisfied when Figma is used
- [ ] `bin/dev-flow design-check {{PROJECT}}` passes before UI implementation, when UI applies
- [ ] `tasks/IMPLEMENTATION_TRACE.md` maps required UI screens to implementation targets and evidence, when UI applies

## Add When The Project Has Code
- [ ] Lint
- [ ] Type check
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Build
- [ ] Browser or device smoke test, when user-facing
- [ ] Functional flow test, when `AUTOMATED_QA` is required
- [ ] Monkey or exploratory stress test, when `AUTOMATED_QA` is required
- [ ] Visual comparison score is at least 90/100 against required design contract inputs, when `VISUAL_QA` is required
- [ ] `bin/dev-flow doctor {{PROJECT}}`, before delivery
- [ ] `bin/dev-flow qa-check {{PROJECT}}`, before delivery only when QA is required
